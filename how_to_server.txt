1. install some python stuff

pip install flask
pip install flask-cors

2. launch server

python server.py

3. launch client in localhost (must be done for annoying CORS security thing)

python -m http.server
open chrome, go to http://localhost:8000/api_test.html
press the 'get data' button and observe if generated python code appears on the page
